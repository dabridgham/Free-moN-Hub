= Free-monN Hub

This is a simple circuit board that acts as a wiring hub for a
Free-moN module or section.  It basically just replaces (some of) the
terminal strips that one might use on a simple module and adds a 12
VDC linear regulator, a reversing relay, and LEDs to indicate power on
the ACC and DCC busses.

See the https://github.com/dabridgham/Free-moN-Hub/wiki[wiki] for more
information.
